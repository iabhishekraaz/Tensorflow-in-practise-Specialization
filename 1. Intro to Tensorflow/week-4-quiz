1.Using Image Generator, how do you label images?
Answer:- It’s based on the directory the image is contained in



2.What method on the Image Generator is used to normalize the image?
Answer:- rescale



3.How did we specify the training size for the images?
Answer:- The target_size parameter on the training generator



4.When we specify the input_shape to be (300, 300, 3), what does that mean?
Answer:- Every Image will be 300x300 pixels, with 3 bytes to define color


5.If your training data is close to 1.000 accuracy, but your validation data isn’t, what’s the risk here?
Answer:- You’re overfitting on your training data



6.Convolutional Neural Networks are better for classifying images like horses and humans because:
Answer:- All of the above


7.After reducing the size of the images, the training results were different. Why?
Answer:- We removed some convolutions to handle the smaller images
