# Tensorflow-in-practise-Specialization

In the TensorFlow in Practice Specialization, you'll review lectures, videos, and practice assessments, that will teach you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems.

In this four-course Specialization, you’ll explore exciting opportunities for AI applications. Begin by developing an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. Improve a network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images. You’ll teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. You’ll even train an AI to create original poetry!
