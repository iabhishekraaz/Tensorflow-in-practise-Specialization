1. Question 1
How do you use Image Augmentation in TensorFLow
Answer:- Using parameters to the ImageDataGenerator



2. Question 2
If my training data only has people facing left, but I want to classify people facing right, how would I avoid overfitting?
Answer:- Use the ‘horizontal_flip’ parameter


3. Question 3
When training with augmentation, you noticed that the training is a little slower. Why?
Answer:- Because the image processing takes cycles



4. Question 4
What does the fill_mode parameter do?
Answer:- It attempts to recreate lost information after a transformation like a shear


5. Question 5
When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.
Answer:- Nothing, all augmentation is done in-memory



6. Question 6
How does Image Augmentation help solve overfitting?
Answer:- It manipulates the training set to generate more scenarios for features in the images



7. Question 7
When using Image Augmentation my training gets...
Answer:- Slower


8. Question 8
Using Image Augmentation effectively simulates having a larger data set for training.
Answer:- True
