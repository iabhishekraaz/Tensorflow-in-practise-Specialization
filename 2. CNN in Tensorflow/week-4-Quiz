1. Question 1
The diagram for traditional programming had Rules and Data In, but what came out?
Answers:- Answers

2. Question 2
Why does the DNN for Fashion MNIST have 10 output neurons?
Answers:- The dataset has 10 classes


3. Question 3
What is a Convolution?
Answers:- A technique to extract features from an image



4. Question 4
Applying Convolutions on top of a DNN will have what impact on training?
Answers:- It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!

5. Question 5
What method on an ImageGenerator is used to normalize the image?
Answers:- rescale


6. Question 6
When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.
Answers:- Nothing


7. Question 7
Can you use Image augmentation with Transfer Learning?
Answers:- Yes. It's pre-trained layers that are frozen. So you can augment your images as you train the bottom layers of the DNN with them


8. Question 8
When training for multiple classes what is the Class Mode for Image Augmentation?
Answers:- class_mode='categorical'
