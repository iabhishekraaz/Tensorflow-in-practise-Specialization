1. Question 1
What does flow_from_directory give you on the ImageGenerator?
Answer:- All of the above


2. Question 2
If my Image is sized 150x150, and I pass a 3x3 Convolution over it, what size is the resulting image?
Answer:- 148x148



3. Question 3
If my data is sized 150x150, and I use Pooling of size 2x2, what size will the resulting image be?
Answer:- 75x75



4. Question 4
If I want to view the history of my training, how can I access it?
Answer:- Create a variable ‘history’ and assign it to the return of model.fit or model.fit_generator



5. Question 5
What’s the name of the API that allows you to inspect the impact of convolutions on the images?
Answer:- The model.layers API



6. Question 6
When exploring the graphs, the loss levelled out at about .75 after 2 epochs, but the accuracy climbed close to 1.0 after 15 epochs. What's the significance of this?
Answer:- There was no point training after 2 epochs, as we overfit to the training data



7. Question 7
Why is the validation accuracy a better indicator of model performance than training accuracy?
Answer:- The validation accuracy is based on images that the model hasn't been trained with, and thus a better indicator of how the model will perform with new images.



8. Question 8
Why is overfitting more likely to occur on smaller datasets?
Answer:- Because there's less likelihood of all possible features being encountered in the training process.
